## _(Initial Configuration)_

You may want to disable key expiration for your server (either by using an 
auth key and connecting via the CLI, or afterwards via the Tailscale admin
console).

## _(System Settings)_

### _(Unraid services listen on Tailscale IP)_

Configures Unraid services (SSH, WebGUI, SMB, etc.) to listen on Tailscale 
addresses.

### _(Enable IP Forwarding)_

This setting modifies the sysctl settings for IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.
This is useful when Tailscale is configured to be a subnet router or
exit node.

When set to Yes, IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding are both turned on.  
When set to No, the plugin does not modify the forwarding settings.

### _(Taildrop Location)_

Enter a valid path here to enable the Unraid server to accept files via
Taildrop.

If this setting is configured, Tailscale will be restarted when the array
starts; this is required for the Taildrop folder to be detected and used.

### _(Allow Usage Data Collection)_

Allows usage information to be collected:

- Anonymized identifier
- Tailscale plugin version
- Unraid version

## _(Tailscale Settings)_

If a setting is set to "Ignore", the plugin will not make any changes to the 
setting in Tailscale. This is useful if you wish to configure settings via 
CLI instead of the WebGUI.

### _(Use Tailscale Subnets)_

When enabled, Unraid will accept routes advertisted from subnet routers in the 
tailnet.

When disabled, Unraid will not accept routes from subnet routers.

### _(Use Tailscale DNS Settings)_

When enabled, Unraid will use the DNS settings configured in the Tailscale 
admin console, including MagicDNS and nameservers.

When disabled, Unraid will use the DNS settings configured in the Unraid 
network settings.

Refer to [https://tailscale.com/kb/1054/dns/](https://tailscale.com/kb/1054/dns/)
for more information on Tailscale DNS configuration.

### _(Use Tailscale SSH)_

When enabled, the Tailscale policy is used to manage access to SSH via 
Tailscale.

When disabled, the built-in Unraid SSH server manages connections via 
Tailscale.

Refer to [https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh/](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh/) 
for more information on Tailscale SSH.

## _(Certificates)_

A Tailscale HTTPS certificate can be used for the WebGUI. Your hostname must
match the name used for the machine in Tailscale.

1. Enable HTTPS for your tailnet.
2. Set the **Local TLD** in **Settings**->**Management Access** to your
   Tailnet name (as displayed in the [DNS](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns)
   page of your Tailscale admin console)
2. Generate a new certificate and copy the to the WebGUI configuration.
   (This can also be run via the User Scripts plugin.)
```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs
cd /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs

source /boot/config/ident.cfg
FQDN=$(hostname).${LOCAL_TLD%%[[:cntrl:]]}

# Have Tailscale generate a new certificate if needed
tailscale cert $FQDN

# Build the PEM bundle
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt > /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key >> /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem

# Update the WebGUI certificate
echo "Copying certificate to WebGUI config"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem /boot/config/ssl/certs/$(hostname)_unraid_bundle.pem
echo "Restarting WebGUI"
/etc/rc.d/rc.nginx reload
```

It is also possible to use these certificates for Docker containers. For
example, to use the generated certificate for Minio:
```
# Copy the files to the Minio container
echo "Copying certificate to Minio"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/public.crt
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/private.key
echo "Restarting Minio"
docker restart Minio
```

## _(Support)_

Support for this plugin is available via the [support thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/136889-plugin-tailscale/)
on the Unraid forums.

**Support for use of advanced networking features such as
subnet routers or docker ipvlan/macvlan networks will be
limited since advanced network features can be dependent 
by the underlying network configuration.**
